   publisher = {Farrar, Straus and Giroux},
   address = {New York, NY, US},
   series = {Thinking, fast and slow.},
   abstract = {In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

   abstract = {End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document. In this work, we propose the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC), a new question answering model that combines information from evidence across multiple documents. The CFC consists of a coarse-grain module that interprets documents with respect to the query then finds a relevant answer, and a fine-grain module which scores each candidate answer by comparing its occurrences across all of the documents with the query. We design these modules using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention, which learn to emphasize different parts of the input. On the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, the CFC obtains a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the blind test set, outperforming the previous best by 3% accuracy despite not using pretrained contextual encoders.},

   abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

   abstract = {Multi-hop path reasoning over knowledge base aims at finding answer entities for an input question by walking along a path of triples from graph structure data, which is a crucial branch in the knowledge base question answering (KBQA) research field. Previous studies rely on deep neural networks to simulate the way humans solve multi-hop questions, which do not consider the latent relation information contained in connected edges, and lack of measuring the correlation between specific relations and the input question. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware graph neural network for multi-hop path reasoning task. First, a query node is directly added to the candidate subgraph retrieved from the knowledge base, which constructs what we term a query graph. This graph construction strategy makes it possible to enhance the information flow between the question and the nodes for the subsequent message passing steps. Second, question-related information contained in the relations is added to the entity node representations during graph updating; meanwhile, the relation representations are updated. Finally, the attention mechanism is used to weight the contribution from neighbor nodes so that only the information of neighbor nodes related to the query can be injected into new node representations. Experimental results on MetaQA and PathQuestion-Large (PQL) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher Hit@1 and F1 scores than the baseline methods by a large margin. Moreover, ablation studies show that both the graph construction and the graph update algorithm contribute to performance improvement.},
