\section{Introduction}

% Start writing your paper here and don't forget to include citations. Example: GCN \cite{RN2}
The task of Machine Reading Comprehension, or MRC is an active area of research in the field of Natural Language Processing. 
The basic goal of MRC is to develop systems that can read and comprehend unstructured passages and answer questions based on them. 

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the task of multi-hop reading comprehension (MHRC), 
where the answer to a question is not directly stated in a single passage, but can be inferred by combining information from multiple documents.
To this end, a number of datasets have been proposed, such as HotpotQA \cite{RN116}, QAngaroo \cite{RN115}, and MuSiQue \cite{RN167}. Some datasets 
also include supporting facts, whose extraction could be seen as providing explainability for MHRC tasks  \cite{RN116} \cite{RN106}.

To solve the task of MHRC, a number of approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into two categories:
Graph-based approaches \cite{RN81} \cite{RN117} \cite{RN118} \cite{RN122} \cite{RN119} \cite{RN91} and Non-graph-based approaches. Most of the methods
can be basically decomposed into a Retrieval phase and a Reading Phase \cite{RN166}. Graph-based approaches can be effective for this task because they 
enable the modeling of complex relationships between entities \cite{RN23}, and provide the integration of global evidence. They can also mimic human 
reasoning processes \cite{RN35}.

%TODO: figure of example multi-hop reasoning problem from HotpotQA

%TODO: brief description of non-graph-based approaches

The first step in Graph-based approaches is to construct either an entity graph \cite{RN81} \cite{RN117} \cite{RN122} \cite{RN141} \cite{RN91} \cite{RN130} 
or a hierarchical graph \cite{RN124} \cite{RN119} \cite{RN130}, to model the relationships in the texts. Once this is done, a GNN-based 
reasoning module is used to perform multi-hop reasoning over the graph, and finally a prediction module is used to predict answers \cite{RN23}.
%TODO: expand this paragraph

Recently, there have been arguments as to whether GNNs are actually necessary for MHRC. Shao et al. (2020) \cite{RN127} argue that 
a graph structure may not be necessary with proper use of pre-trained models, and that the graph structure can be regarded as task-specific 
prior knowledge. Groenveld et al. (2020) \cite{RN126} showed that a simple BERT-based model can outperform a Graph-based model on the HotpotQA dataset,
and that supporting sentence identification in HotpotQA might not be a multi-hop problem at all. Wu et al. (2021) \cite{RN106} suggested that
the paragraph retrieval stage might be more important than the reasoning stage in MHRC, and that the reasoning stage might not be a multi-hop problem.
%TODO: motivation for survey - is GNN necessary for MHRC?
%TODO: mention Min et al. argument about the MHRC Dataset problem

In this paper, we present a survey of various approaches that have been proposed for MHRC, with a focus on Graph-based approaches. We also try to
address the question of whether GNNs are actually necessary for MHRC. We first present a taxonomy of the various approaches, and then discuss the
core concepts of MHRC. We then present a detailed discussion of the various approaches, and finally conclude with a discussion of the open problems and future directions.
